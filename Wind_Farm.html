        <p>Wind power is considered a clean energy source because it produces electricity without emitting greenhouse gases or other pollutants. Unlike fossil fuels such as coal or natural gas, wind power does not rely on the combustion of finite resources, making it environmentally friendly.</p>
        <p>In 2022, wind supplied over 2000 TWh of electricity, which was over 7% of world electricity[1]: 58  and about 2% of world energy.With about 100 GW added during 2021, mostly in China and the United States, global installed wind power capacity exceeded 800 GW.To help meet the Paris Agreement goals to limit climate change, analysts say it should expand much faster - by over 1% of electricity generation per year.</p>

        <h2>History</h2>
        <p>Wind power has been used as long as humans have put sails into the wind. King Hammurabi's Codex (reign 1792 - 1750 BC) already mentioned windmills for generating mechanical energy. Wind-powered machines used to grind grain and pump water, the windmill and wind pump, were developed in what is now Iran, Afghanistan, and Pakistan by the 9th century. Wind power was widely available and not confined to the banks of fast-flowing streams, or later, requiring sources of fuel. Wind-powered pumps drained the polders of the Netherlands, and in arid regions such as the American mid-west or the Australian outback, wind pumps provided water for livestock and steam engines.</p>
